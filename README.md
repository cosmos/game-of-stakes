## Updates

### Launch policy

We will commit to a 1 week feature freeze on testnet release but only 1 day on a bugfix release.

Monday was the last feature release expected and validators are playing with min freeze and gas limits for the first time on [genki-3001](https://github.com/certusone/genki-3001).

The Tendermint liveness bug discovered on `genki-3000` is being investigated thanks to some amazing contributions of forensic artifacts from the community.

Dec 18th 06:00 UTC is the current target for GoS.

If you have feeling about the delay or want to join the community testnet, chat here: [Riot](https://matrix.to/#/!RKBbCjMEiDPKKewRIE:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=t2bot.io)
